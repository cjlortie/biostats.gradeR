##BIOL5081: Biostatistics   

![](./can.do.png)

The goal was statistical thinking through R and good data science. Data frames, EDA, and effective graphics can enhance our capacity to use statistical thinking to solve problems and examine evidence. Real data were used to both practice, time-bounded code (hackathon model), and follow-up revise workflow and analyses.

###Time-bounded hackathon
```{r, test 1}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tibble)
library(knitr)
library(fitdistrplus)

#read data
metrics <-read.csv('data/BIOL5081.2016.grades.csv')
#as_tibble(metrics)
#table so people can see their scores
kable(metrics)

#data viz for pattern analysis and exploration of potential stats
ggplot(metrics, aes(dataset, total)) + 
  geom_boxplot()

ggplot(metrics, aes(total, colour = dataset)) +
         geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 1.5)

#EDA on distribution
shapiro.test(metrics$total) 
qqnorm(metrics$total)
descdist(metrics$total, boot = 1000)

summary(metrics)

popular.datasets <- metrics %>% group_by(dataset) %>% tally()
ggplot(popular.datasets, aes(dataset, sort(n))) + 
  geom_density() + coord_flip() 

#indication that the dataset related to total score
m1 <- lm(total~dataset, data = metrics)
summary(m1)
anova(m1) #no indication that the dataset significantly influenced scores
#however, sample sizes very uneven

m2 <- kruskal.test(total~dataset, data = metrics)
m2 #still no difference


```
